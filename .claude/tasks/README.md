# Tasks

This folder contains task-specific instructions and plans for larger efforts. Each significant task or feature gets its own collaborative document to track context, decisions, and progress across sessions.

## Structure

Each task file should follow this template:

```markdown
# [Task Name]

## Status

[active | paused | completed]

## Goal

## Instructions

The human provided initial instructions for how to approach the task. This typically involves preparatory analysis of what needs to be done and results in a summary and plan under the
["Execution Plan"](#execution-plan) section.

## Context

Background information, related files, prior discussions.

## Execution Plan
